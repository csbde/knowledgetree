Windows Specific Installation Instructions
==========================================

Installation on Windows XP and 2003 requires a slightly different approach to
the *NIX one.  

The easiest installation approach is to use our Windows installer.  You can
find this for download on SourceForge, alongside our usual install bundles:

Manual Install (XAMPP)
----------------------

If you need to do a manual installation of KnowledgeTree for some reason,
we recommend using a bundled version of Apache, MySQL and PHP.  For testing 
purposes, we use XAMPP (version 1.5.1):

  http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
  
NOTE
  
  At this time, KnowledgeTree 3 supports only PHP 4.x, so please ensure that
  your XAMPP install is using PHP 4.
  
  Details can be found inside the XAMPP control panel, under the menu item
  PHP Switch.

General procedure:

  * Install XAMPP
  
  * Extract the KnowledgeTree zipfile inside the XAMPP htdocs directory.  If
    you installed XAMPP in
    
      c:\Program Files\xampp
      
    then you need to extract KnowledgeTree so that its files are in 
    
      c:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\knowledgeTree
      
    This will be referred to as "<knowledgeTree>" in paths from here on.
      
  * Conduct the Pre-installation checkup.  Assuming you are running XAMPP on 
    "localhost", visit
  
      http://localhost/knowledgeTree/setup/
      
  * Configure the Database.  The most effective way to do this with XAMPP is 
    to use phpmyadmin:
    
      http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
      
      1.  Create a new database (call it "dms")
      2.  Create the tables:
      
        - open the "dms" database from the left-menu/.
        - go to "SQL" at the top of the screen.
        - Where it says "Location of the text file" click browse and then run:
        
          * <knowledgeTree>\sql\mysql\install\structure.sql
          * <knowledgeTree>\sql\mysql\install\data.sql
          * <knowledgeTree>\sql\mysql\install\user.sql
          
  *  Configure your installation in <knowledgeTree>config\config.ini:

   - The default configuration will determine many settings on your
     installation automatically, and this is the preferred method of
     running KnowledgeTree.  Please do not manually set these settings
     unless you know what you are doing.

   - The default configuration uses the database username and password
     in the user.sql file mentioned above, use the local host for the
     database, and use the database named 'dms'.  If you follow the
     examples above in setting up the database, this means KnowledgeTree
     should be fully configured to start working.

   - However, you should change this once you've performed your initial
     evalution of KnowledgeTree for the security of your documents.

   - The following settings in config/environment.php control the
     database connectivity, and can be set as shown:
     
        [db]
        dbHost           = localhost
        dbName           = dms
        dbUser           = myuser
        dbPass           = mypassword
        
  * Check the post-installation checklist:

    If your knowledgeTree installation is at http://localhost/, go to:

      http://localhost/setup/

    And click on "Post-installation checkup".
    
  *  Login:
   - in a web browser go to your KnowledgeTree installation via the web
   - default user is "admin" with password "admin"

  *  Register the standard plugins.
  
   - in a web browser go to "DMS Administration" , then "Miscellaneous",
     then "Manage Plugins"
   - click "Reread plugins" to load the list of available plugins.
   - enable the plugins as required.
   
    * Please note: *
   Fulltext indexing of files (e.g. checking their contents) needs to be
   activated from this menu or the full-text search WILL NOT work.
   

File Indexing
-------------

The file indexing facilities of KnowledgeTree make use of external
programs to perform their jobs.

At the moment, the "catdoc" (http://www.45.free.net/~vitus/ice/catdoc/)
and "xpdf" packages contains all the external programs you need.
Installing this package is beyond the scope of this document - please
consult the KnowledgeTree Wiki at http://support.ktdms.com/confluence/
to see how others have approached this on your platform.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Please make sure that your KnowledgeTree installation passes all the
pre- and post-installation checkups first.
