KnowledgeTree Installation Notes
--------------------------------

*  KnowledgeTree requires the following software to run:
   -  Apache 1.3 or above
   -  MySQL 4.0 or above with INNODB support
   -  PHP 4.3.0 or above, but not yet PHP 5.0


*  Move the knowledgeTree folder to the directory it is going to be served from:
   $ mv knowledgeTree /path/to/your/html/directory/

*  Configure your web server to access the KnowledgeTree system.

   Due to the many different configuration possibilities, these can not
   all be discussed here.  Please consult the KnowledgeTree Wiki system
   at http://support.ktdms.com/confluence/ to see what others have done
   on your platform, and discuss the pros and cons of various options on
   the KnowledgeTree Forums at http://forum.ktdms.com/

*  Check the pre-installation checkup:

   If your knowledgeTree installation is at http://localhost/, go to:

       http://localhost/setup/

*  Set up the database
   
   On a Unix-like system, the command line tools can generally be used:

   - Create a database:
     $ mysqladmin -p create dms

   - Create and populate the tables:
     $ mysql -p dms < sql/mysql/install/structure.sql
     $ mysql -p dms < sql/mysql/install/data.sql

   - Create the database users
     $ mysql -p dms < sql/mysql/install/user.sql

   These tools may requite the setting of the user (-u username) and of
   a password (-p, and you will be asked for the password).

   Using other tools is beyond the scope of this document.  Consult the
   KnowledgeTree Wiki at http://support.ktdms.com/confluence/ to see how
   others have approached this on your platform.

*  Configure your installation in config/config.ini:
   - The default configuration will determine many settings on your
     installation automatically, and this is the preferred method of
     running KnowledgeTree.  Please do not manually set these settings
     unless you know what you are doing.

   - The default configuration uses the database username and password
     in the user.sql file mentioned above, use the local host for the
     database, and use the database named 'dms'.  If you follow the
     examples above in setting up the database, this means KnowledgeTree
     should be fully configured to start working.

   - However, you should change this once you've performed your initial
     evalution of KnowledgeTree for the security of your documents.

   - The following settings in config/environment.php control the
     database connectivity, and can be set as shown:
        [db]
        dbHost           = localhost
        dbName           = dms
        dbUser           = myuser
        dbPass           = mypassword

*  Check permissions on the folders
   - The "var" folder in the root of the KnowledgeTree
     installation MUST be able to be written to by your web server.

   - The pre-configuration checkup will display the user which must be
     able to write to these folders.

   - The remaining folders should preferably not be able to be written
     to by your web server.

   - eg.
     If your web server is running as user "nobody" and group "nogroup"
     then cd to the files directory and type:

     *nix: 'chown -R nobody.nogroup var'
     Windows: Check the permissions and security tabs


*  Check the post-installation checklist:

   If your knowledgeTree installation is at http://localhost/, go to:

       http://localhost/setup/

   And click on "Post-installation checkup".


*  Login:
   - in a web browser go to your KnowledgeTree installation via the web
   - default user is "admin" with password "admin"

*  Register the standard plugins.
   - in a web browser go to "DMS Administration" , then "Miscellaneous",
     then "Manage Plugins"
   - click "Reread plugins" to load the list of available plugins.
   - enable the plugins as required.
   
   * Please note: *
   Fulltext indexing of files (e.g. checking their contents) needs to be
   activated from this menu or the full-text search WILL NOT work.

External applications
---------------------

The file indexing and other facilities of KnowledgeTree make use of
external applications to perform their jobs.

For the Windows platform, these are:

. catdoc - http://www.45.free.net/~vitus/ice/catdoc/
. xpdf - http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
. InfoZip unzip and zip - http://www.info-zip.org/

Installing these packages is beyond the scope of this document - please
consult the KnowledgeTree Wiki at http://support.ktdms.com/confluence/
to see how others have approached this on your platform.  We recommend
that you use the appropriate package management procedures for
installing these packages on your system to ensure ease of maintenance
and upgrade.

NOTE:  if you install the packages outside of the path normally searched
by your operating system (e.g. in c:\antiword or /usr/local/bin) you will
need to specify the _full_ path to the actual applications (e.g. 
/usr/local/bin/pdftotext).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Please make sure that your KnowledgeTree installation passes all the
pre- and post-installation checkups first.
