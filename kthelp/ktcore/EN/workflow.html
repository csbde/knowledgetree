<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>Workflow may be defined as the process a document goes 
through to serve its purpose in an organization. For example, an invoice is 
created, distributed, then paid; a report may be created, reviewed, edited, and 
distributed. </p>
<p>Some documents, such as tenders, may have complex 
workflows, requiring input from several people within and outside of your 
organization before the work is complete. </p>
<p>The KnowledgeTree administrator defines and manages 
document workflows in DMS administration, and any KnowledgeTree user may be 
involved in a document workflow. </p>
<p>Workflows in KnowledgeTree involve three key areas:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#assign">Assigning workflows</a></li>
	<li><a href="#states">States and Transitions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#effects">Workflow effects (Actions)</a></li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="assign"></a>Assigning workflows</h3>
<p >A document in the repository can have 
only one workflow attached to it at any given time. By default, workflows are 
not automatically attached to new documents when theyre added to the 
repository. However, the administrator may configure the system to assign 
workflows when new documents are created, or to assign workflows only to 
specific documents. Users are also allowed to select and assign workflows to the 
documents they are working with  provided they have the permissions to do so. 
</p>
<h3><a name="states"></a>States and Transitions</h3>
<p >Workflows consist of states and 
transitions. A state may be defined as a stage in a documents lifecycle, such 
as billed or draft. Each workflow has a starting state, which is the initial 
state for any document in a workflow.</p>
<p >Transitions, which may be defined as the 
way in which documents move between states, are an essential part of the 
workflow. Each state can have one or more transitions, depending on how the 
administrator has created the workflow.</p>
<p >Transitions point to the next step in 
the workflow, such as send to client or review, which effectively changes the 
state of the document. Transitions represent the actions that may be performed 
on a document. For example, an invoice starts in the generated state; then it is 
sent to client, before it is marked as billed.  Transitions are said to be 
guarded  not all users are allowed to access them. In a publication workflow 
for example, only users with the role reviewer would be allowed to review a 
document, and to move it from draft to published.</p>
<h3><a name="effects"></a>Workflow effects (Actions)</h3>
<p >Workflows are more than just states and 
transitions. Users and administrators use workflows to restrict, deny or grant 
access to documents in the repository, based on the documents position in the 
workflow. For example, a state can restrict both actions and permissions on a 
document  only reviewers may be allowed to discuss draft documents for 
instance, while clients will be disallowed from viewing unbilled invoices, and 
published documents will be prevented from being checked in or checked out of 
the repository. Additionally, users in specified Roles or Groups can be notified 
when a document reaches a certain state in a workflow. These notifications 
display on the Dashboard and are emailed to users with specified email accounts.</p>
